In addition to checking out old commits and old file revisions, git checkout is also the means to navigate 
existing branches. Combined with the basic Git commands, itâ€™s a way to work on a particular line of development.

Removes untracked files from the working directory. This is the logical counterpart to git reset, which (typically) 
only operates on tracked files.

Creates a copy of an existing Git repository. Cloning is the most common way for developers to obtain a working 
copy of a central repository.

Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic 
workflow for all Git users.
Passing the --amend flag to git commit lets you amend the most recent commit. This is very useful when you forget 
to stage a file or omit important information from the commit message.
